[Chorus:]
Today's gonna' be the best day of my life... so far!
Today's gonna' be the best day of my life... so far!
I've no particular reason why I think today's gonna be so nice.
But today's gonna' be the best day of my life... so far!

No, it's not my birthday, or the end of school
And I didn't win the lottery, or anything that cool.

I didn't get a trophy for something great I've done
But, I say today's gonna be so great, it's only just because:

Just because I feel like having the best day I can
And if you don't like it, then I guess that's your problem

[Chorus]

Why do I need a reason to have an awesome day?
For me it's enough when I wake up and look around and say-

"Hey! Today's gonna be the best day that I have ever had."
And I'm not quite sure if it's going to work but I'll try the best I can.

Just because I feel like having the best day I can
And if you don't like it, then I guess that's your problem

[Chorus]

And if I fail to have the best day that I can
Then I'll wait for tomorrow and try it once again.
And again, and again, and again, and again
Again! Again! Again! Again! Again!

[Chorus x2]
